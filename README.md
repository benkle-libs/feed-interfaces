Interfaces for my feed libraries
================================

You probably won't need this library directly. It mostly exists to share interfaces between [feed-parser](https://github.com/benkle-libs/feed-parser)
and [feed-response](https://github.com/benkle-libs/feed-response).
If you need it yourself, you can it require like any other package, thou:
```sh
    composer require benkle/feed-interfaces
```
